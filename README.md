# **UX Development**   
### **USER STORIES**
#### **NEW USER OR RETURNING USERS**
As a new user/ registered shopper, I want to:
1.	Be able to find weather information easier. 
2.	Be able to save Country and City data in order to easily access more weather information about a saved city. 
3.  Be able to delete Country and City data along with its metadata. 

## **DESIGN**   
### **Color Scheme**  
The colours used in the design for the  Weather App was blue. The colour was inspired by the sky in order for the user to intuitively understand the purpose of the site. 

### **Typography**  
The [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) Quicksand has been used to give the site a clean a friendly clean minimalist design.

### **GENERAL FEATURES ON ALL PAGES :**  
   - **Fully Responsive**: Each page is fully responsive across all devices and has been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.

   - **Navigation Bar** - There is a fully responsive navigation bar on all pages. 

   - **Modal** - On the single view page , a modal appears to allow the user to conduct basic operations such as deleting a sensor data. When the admin user wants to conduct any delete functionality, a popup appears to verify their action.

### **FEATURES OF EACH PAGE**     

#### **1. Home Page**

When visiting the weather app page, the user can enter both the country name and the city name to find their sensor metdata. When a user adds a sensor, the homepage displays all of the sensors.

The site has been kept clean in order for users to easily navigate and interact with it. To draw the user's attention, the header phrase, which welcomes the user to the site, is placed in the center of the site.

#### **2. Single View Page**

The page displays more detailed weather metdata for each sensor.
- It contains the following elements: the sensor image for the country, the weather temperature for the same day with minimum and maximum temperatures. In addition, wind, humidity, and temperature data are provided.
