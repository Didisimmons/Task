# **UX Development**   
### **USER STORIES**
#### **NEW USER OR RETURNING USERS**
As a new user/ registered shopper, I want to:
1.	Be able to find weather information easier. 
2.	Be able to save Country and City data in order to easily access more weather information about a saved city. 
3.  Be able to delete Country and City data along with its metadata. 

## **DESIGN**   
### **Color Scheme**  
The colours used in the design for the  Weather App was blue. The colour was inspired by the sky in order for the user to intuitively understand the purpose of the site. 

### **Typography**  
The [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) Quicksand has been used to give the site a clean a friendly clean minimalist design.
